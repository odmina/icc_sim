# Lost between datapoints

This is a simulation showing that when datapoints in longitudinal studies are too sparse we may be missing some transient effects. The simulation is used to make a point that we need better data in suicide research and is meant to give one of possible reasons why RR observed in suicide research are so low (see: Franklin, J. C., Ribeiro, J. D., Fox, K. R., Bentley, K. H., Kleiman, E. M., Huang, X., ... & Nock, M. K. (2017). Risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors: A meta-analysis of 50 years of research.
